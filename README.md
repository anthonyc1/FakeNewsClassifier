# FakeNewsClassifier
We wanted to apply data science and machine learning models to the topic of fake news. My team was inspired by after finding this [article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/identifying-fake-news-nlp/ "NYC Data Science article").

Steps we took:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Preprocessing the Text
4. Text-to-Features Conversion
5. Model Selection
6. Classification


For a full breakdown of what we did, check out our [report](https://github.com/anthonyc1/FakeNewsClassifier/blob/master/fakeNewsClassifierReport.pdf "Project Report").
